# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). The user can set up an account to store the links they shorten and have the ability to edit / delete those links.

Extra functionality includes: analytics! Track how many times your links have been visited with total traffic, total unique viewers, and timestamps for creation and visits.
